# Deserve

Deserve is a nanoframework for serving ML models. Flasker than Flask, faster than FastAPI, Deserve is asynchronous, lightweight and simple.

### Features

* ðŸ¤™ Remote procedure call (RPC) architecture. There are no endpoints, methods, paths, nor resources to make decisions about â€” just the `host`:`port`.
* ðŸ“¦ Send JSON, receive JSON, client-side. Accept a Python object, return an object, server-side. Conversions happen under the hood.

### Installing

```sh
$ pip install deserve
```

Also install an ASGI server such as [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org) or [Hypercorn](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/hypercorn).

```sh
$ pip install hypercorn
```

### Quickstart

This example uses the [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/quicktour) library.

```py
# Save this as example.py
import deserve
from transformers import pipeline

# Load your model
classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')

@deserve
async def predict(payload: object) -> object:
    return classifier(payload)
```

Run the server using the names of your file (`example.py`) and function (`predict`).

```sh
$ hypercorn example:predict

[INFO] Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Get some predictions.

```sh
$ curl localhost:8000 --data '["This is the simplest framework.", "You deserve it!"]'

[{"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.799}, {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.998}]
```
